# To-Do Task Manager

Welcome to the **To-Do Task Manager** web application!

This project is a simple but fully functional task manager with authentication, allowing users to:
- Create an account (Sign Up)
- Log in with Email/Password or Google Account
- Add, complete, and delete tasks
- Secure logout and dashboard protection
- Hosted online on GitHub Pages

## Live Demo

## Features

- Firebase Authentication (Email/Password and Google Sign-In)
- Responsive design (Bootstrap 5.3)
- Protected Dashboard (only logged-in users can access)
- Real-time task adding, completing, and deleting (local for now)
- Clean and modern UI

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)

## How It Works

- **Sign Up**: Users can create a new account using their email and password.

- **Dashboard**: After logging in, users can manage their daily tasks.
- **Logout**: Securely log out and prevent unauthorized access to the dashboard.

## Future Improvements (Optional)
